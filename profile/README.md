## HKUST - AI4Reasoning Team

Data-driven large language models (LLMs) hold immense potential in advancing human-AI symbiosis. As a research team at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), we actively focus on developing reasoning techniques for LLMs. 


Specifically, we work on complex reasoning in professional domains such as law, mathematics, finance, and medicine to promote the proliferation of machine intelligence in these fields.
